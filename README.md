# 🌟🎄 Advent of Code 2023 🎄🌟

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one ⭐️.

For the full puzzle text and challenge explanation, please see [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about).

## My solutions

I'll be using JavaScript. My aim is to solve the day's challenge and get the correct output - I'm not following best practices, or trying to achieve code perfection. But I am building a toolkit of how to solve different kinds of problems and learning a little about algorithms and data structures particularly for large data sets (code that's still running after 3 hours vs. code that completes the same problem in seconds 😅), along the way.

|Puzzle      | Solution       | Result    | Comments  |
|------------|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| [Day 13: Point of Incidence](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/13) | [Code](https://github.com/sarahc-dev/advent-of-code/tree/main/day-13-point-of-incidence) | ⭐️⭐️ | Spent a lot of time trying to debug an error that did not appear within the example data today. Had to figure out which grids in the data were not producing the correct result to finally figure out the problem. |
| [Day 12: Hot Springs](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/12) | [Code](https://github.com/sarahc-dev/advent-of-code/tree/main/day-12-hot-springs) | ⭐️ | Haven't completed part 2 yet - need to find a more performant solution, as my current way of testing every possible combination is too slow to run in part 2. |
| [Day 11: Cosmic Expansion](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/11) | [Code](https://github.com/sarahc-dev/advent-of-code/tree/main/day-11-cosmic-expansion) | ⭐️⭐️ | My choices for solving part 1 didn't translate directly to part 2 so had to tweak it a little. Part 2 would work for both. Found today much easier than yesterday |
| [Day 10: Pipe Maze](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/10) | [Code](https://github.com/sarahc-dev/advent-of-code/tree/main/day-10-pipe-maze) | ⭐️⭐️ | I feel like there is a better solution for finding the first pipe - potentially using the same function for getting the next pipe rather than separate. Part 2 was a real struggle. I tried a number of different things that didn't work. It took visualising the actual loop for me to conceptualise inside and outside of it - I've added my diagrams of the loop |
| [Day 9: Mirage Maintenance](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/9) | [Code](https://github.com/sarahc-dev/advent-of-code/tree/main/day-9-mirage-maintenance) | ⭐️⭐️ | Got to practice recursion 😀 |
| [Day 8: Haunted Wasteland](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/8) | [Code](https://github.com/sarahc-dev/advent-of-code/tree/main/day-8-haunted-wasteland) | ⭐️⭐️ | Part 2 totally stumped me and had to seek help. I hadn't fully understood there was only one route from A-Z for each node which tripped up my initial attempts. Learnt what LCM is! |
| [Day 7: Camel Cards](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/7) | [Code](https://github.com/sarahc-dev/advent-of-code/tree/main/day-7-camel-cards) | ⭐️⭐️ | Enjoyed today's challenges. Happy with my chosen solution to map out the hands by count and it set me up well for part 2 |
| [Day 6: Wait For It](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/6) | [Code](https://github.com/sarahc-dev/advent-of-code/tree/main/day-6-wait-for-it) | ⭐️⭐️ | Today's challenge felt like light relief after the last few and allowed me to catch up. |
| [Day 5: If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/5) | [Code](https://github.com/sarahc-dev/advent-of-code/tree/main/day-5-fertilizer) | ⭐️⭐️ | Part 2 was the first introduction to computational problems when dealing with data at scale. I learnt that arrays are no good when dealing with a large amount of data and so instead of saving to an array I should compute as I go. The code takes about 10 mins to run (on my 10 year old mac) so I think there's still improvements that could be made. |
| [Day 4: Scratchcards](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/4) | [Code](https://github.com/sarahc-dev/advent-of-code/tree/main/day-4-scratchcards) | ⭐️⭐️ | Wasted a lot of time on part 2 because I hadn't understood the requirement. Lesson was to make sure I understand what I'm being asked to do before I start. |
| [Day 3: Gear Ratios](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3) | [Code](https://github.com/sarahc-dev/advent-of-code/tree/main/day-3-gear-ratios) | ⭐️⭐️ | My solutions to today's challenges are particularly ugly  - but they did the job |
| [Day 2: Cube Conundrum](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2) | [Code](https://github.com/sarahc-dev/advent-of-code/tree/main/day-2-cube-conundrum) | ⭐️⭐️ | Learnt to manipulate the data from a .txt file to a more usable format |
| [Day 1: Trebuchet?!](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1) | [Code](https://github.com/sarahc-dev/advent-of-code/tree/main/day-1-trebuchet) | ⭐️⭐️ | The first and only time I manually converted the dataset as I didn't understand what was coming up 😅 |
